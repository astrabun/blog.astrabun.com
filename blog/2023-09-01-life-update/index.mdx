# 2023-09-01 **Life Update: Where I've Been and What I've Been Up To**

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

It's been a hot minute since I've sat down to actually write a blog post. In fact, the ONLY blog post I published so far was a complaint and pseudo-investigation into suspicious TikTok accounts. You might be wondering, "Where's Astra? What happened to the Twitch streams and TikToks?" Worry not, I'm still here, just navigating through the twists and turns of life.

## **Why the Radio Silence?**

I've been deep into my day job. Don't get me wrong, I still love what I do. If you had told younger me that I'd get paid to work in cybersecurity, well first I would have said â€œno way, thatâ€™s NOT what Iâ€™m going to do when I grow up," but if you fast-forwarded a few years to when I realized I did want to do security, I would have told you that youâ€™re dreaming. But lately, it's been more challenging than ever. You know that feeling of "I get paid to do something I love and would do for fun/free"? Yeah, thatâ€™s slowly been transforming into "I wish they would pay me more to do these chores." I think the more Iâ€™ve built a reputation for being good at this kind of thing, professionally, the more itâ€™s felt like **work**, and the harder it is to have fun with it - the harder it is to remember that it is something I love. And hey, I'm curiousâ€”have any of you been through something similar? Maybe it's not cybersecurity; maybe it's your studies, your artwork, your streaming - anything. You start something because you love it, but somewhere along the way, it starts to feel like a grind. If you've been through this, how have you coped? And if you're in the thick of it right now, just know you're not alone. I'd love to hear your experiences and coping strategies.

## **What's Next?**

Here's the good news: I miss doing non-security things too - streaming, TikTok, etc. I miss the incredible vibes in chat when I stream or drop a new TikTok. So, I'm brainstorming ways to make more time for what makes both you and me happy. I tried a new schedule for a bit (Friday night streams) but some weeks were just so much mental strain that I didnâ€™t have anything left in me by the end of the week. Trying to figure it out, promise. 

## **Wrapping Up**

Life is weird sometimes, isn't it? I'm trying to stay strong and positive, even when the going gets tough. And I'm hopeful that soon, very soon, you'll see me back to doing cool stuffâ€”streaming, making TikToks, and connecting with all of you.

Stay tuned, and thanks for sticking with me. 

<3 Astra
