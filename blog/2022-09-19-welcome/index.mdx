Hello and welcome to my blog!

I plan on using this space to document projects I'm working on and other longer-form text content that doesn't quite belong on other platforms on which I am a user. 

For the time being, I'm planning on using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to maintain this blog due to its simplicity in setup and authoring. While it may typically be used for documentation purposes, I am a fan of how it handles blogs, so that's the piece I'll be using.

This blog should also be going live very close to when my main "Linktree-like" website goes live. To find me elsewhere on the web, check out [astrabun.com](https://astrabun.com) -- made using React JS + MUIv5. This links hub project was the second time I think I've used TypeScript, which has certainly been interesting so far. Previously, any modern front-end web development I've done has been purely in JavaScript, but from what I've seen in TS so far, I've liked it!

As a final note on programming/coding/scripting languages, I've definitely got more formal and professional experience with Python, but it is also worth mentioning that most of my knowledge in this space is self-taught. There's always more to learn, and that's exciting! (Also I'm trying to teach myself golang nowadays too).

Well, until next time!

<3, Astra
