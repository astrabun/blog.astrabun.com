In fact, the ONLY blog post I published so far was a complaint and pseudo-investigation into suspicious TikTok accounts. You might be wondering, \\"Where\'s Astra? What happened to the Twitch streams and TikToks?\\" Worry not, I\'m still here, just navigating through the twists and turns of life.\\n\\n## **Why the Radio Silence?**\\n\\nI\'ve been deep into my day job. Don\'t get me wrong, I still love what I do. If you had told younger me that I\'d get paid to work in cybersecurity, well first I would have said \u201cno way, that\u2019s now that I\u2019m going to do when I grow up, but if you fast-forwarded a few years to when I realized I did want to do security, I would have told you that you\u2019re dreaming. But lately, it\'s been more challenging than ever. You know that feeling of \\"I get paid to do something I love and would do for fun/free\\"? Yeah, that\u2019s slowly been transforming into \\"I wish they would pay me more to do these chores.\\" I think the more I\u2019ve built a reputation for being good at this kind of thing, professionally, the more it\u2019s felt like **work**, and the harder it is to have fun with it - the harder it is to remember that it is something I love. And hey, I\'m curious\u2014have any of you been through something similar? Maybe it\'s not cybersecurity; maybe it\'s your studies, your artwork, your streaming - anything. You start something because you love it, but somewhere along the way, it starts to feel like a grind. If you\'ve been through this, how have you coped? And if you\'re in the thick of it right now, just know you\'re not alone. I\'d love to hear your experiences and coping strategies.\\n\\n## **What\'s Next?**\\n\\nHere\'s the good news: I miss doing non-security things too - streaming, TikTok, etc. I miss the incredible vibes in chat when I stream or drop a new TikTok. So, I\'m brainstorming ways to make more time for what makes both you and me happy. I tried a new schedule for a bit (Friday night streams) but some weeks were just so much mental strain that I didn\u2019t have anything left in me by the end of the week. Trying to figure it out, promise. \\n\\n## **Wrapping Up**\\n\\nLife is weird sometimes, isn\'t it? I\'m trying to stay strong and positive, even when the going gets tough. And I\'m hopeful that soon, very soon, you\'ll see me back to doing cool stuff\u2014streaming, making TikToks, and connecting with all of you.\\n\\nStay tuned, and thanks for sticking with me. \\n\\n<3 Astra"},{"id":"2022/09/20/tiktok-strange-follows","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/09/20/tiktok-strange-follows","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-20-tiktok-strange-follows/index.mdx","title":"The Curious Case of az09813: The Pattern So Far","description":"TikTok is an imperfect social media platform (well, aren\'t most?).

ON TikTok. Users refer to the platform as \\"clock app\\" and other similar names to avoid keyword detection (a key feature of TikTok is its automatic caption generation, so TikTok is probably already doing recognition on words in the audio already). This is why I\'ve decided to write about this on my blog rather than make a TikTok about it, at least until I think of a clever enough way to make a short-form video about the specific issue I will spend the rest of this post describing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## az09813, or rather... /[a-z0-9]{8,13}/\\n\\nBy this point, if you paid attention to the title, you may be curious about what I could possibly be referring to by `az09813`. It would be more accurate to write `/[a-z0-9]{8,13}/`, or the [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) of the numerous accounts that have started following my account over the last week or so. These accounts, I should mention, do not solely follow me, but we\'ll get into patterns shortly. \\n\\n<details>\\n  <summary>List of {Object.keys(userData.users).length} Suspicious Accounts That Have Followed Me (Updated {userData.metadata.last_updated.split(\'.\')[0]} ET)</summary>\\n  <div>\\n    {Object.keys(userData.users).map(e => <pre>{e}</pre>)}\\n  </div>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\nMy goal with this post is twofold: 1) explore the similarities and/or differences between these users, and 2) point out what seems to me like a flaw with TikTok moderation and account verification. I\'ve collected any available information on these accounts using an unofficial TikTok API service to try and make this process less manual.\\n\\n### Observations:\\n\\n<div style={{ fontStyle: \\"italic\\" }}>\\n  {`(from ${nonNullUsers.length} accounts that haven\'t been banned at the time of first data collection)`}\\n</div>\\n\\n#### Regions observed: \\n<pre>\\n  {\\n    JSON.stringify(\\n      regionCounts\\n    )\\n  }\\n</pre>\\n\\n#### Average number of followers the account had:\\n\\n<pre>\\n  {averageFollowerCount}\\n</pre>\\n\\n#### Average number of users the account was following:\\n\\n<pre>\\n  {averageFollowingCount}\\n</pre>\\n\\n#### \\"unique_id_modify_time\\":\\n\\n<pre>\\n  {JSON.stringify(uid_mod_times, null, \\"  \\")}\\n</pre>\\n\\n\\n### Actions\\n\\nAfter seeing an initial flood of these users following me (the first 8 or so followed all within a day) and then a trickle (one every day or every other day, so far continuing through the date of this blog post\'s publishing), I decided to report the accounts and block them. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src={imgReportReasons} alt=\\"Report Reasons\\" style={{ width: \'50%\', display: \\"block\\", marginLeft: \\"auto\\", marginRight: \\"auto\\" }} />\\n  <figcaption align=\\"center\\" style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n    <b>Report Reasons</b>\\n  </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nHowever, TikTok\'s reporting options for accounts do not really account for \\"this account looks suspicious to me but they haven\'t *technically* done anything yet...\\". \\n\\nNonetheless, I reported anyway as the \\"Other\\" reason since these accounts were following too quickly and had remarkably similar, appearing-to-be-randomly-generated names - and I wanted to see what TikTok support would do. \\n\\nIt may or may not surprise you that the response was...\\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src={imgReportStatus} alt=\\"The only FAST turnaround time I\'ve gotten with TikTok support -- telling me my suspicious account report is bogus. Welp.\\" style={{ width: \'50%\', display: \\"block\\", marginLeft: \\"auto\\", marginRight: \\"auto\\" }} />\\n  <figcaption align=\\"center\\" style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n    <b>The only FAST turnaround time I\'ve gotten with TikTok support -- telling me my suspicious account report is bogus. Welp.</b>\\n  </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nChecking back in on these accounts within a day or so revealed that many, but not all, had eventually been banned. I am unsure if this is due to a number of other user reports, or if the accounts had done any commenting or statistically-manipulating behavior. \\n\\n<figure>\\n  <img src={imgReportFollowUps} alt=\\"A view of my TikTok system notifications within a few days of the start of this activity.\\" style={{ width: \'50%\', display: \\"block\\", marginLeft: \\"auto\\", marginRight: \\"auto\\" }} />\\n  <figcaption align=\\"center\\" style={{ textAlign: \\"center\\" }}>\\n    <b>A view of my TikTok system notifications within a few days of the start of this activity. \\"Tik Toker\\" implies the user has been banned, whereas the presence of an original, randomly generated username implies the user is still active. </b>\\n  </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nI also took time to look at some of the other accounts these spam(?)/suspicious accounts were following. While I am not including this data in this blog post specifically, I will share a few qualitative observations:\\n\\n- Multiple other furries seemed to be followed by SOME of these accounts\\n- Most accounts appeared to be regular people, so maybe not specifically targeted at all\\n- The accounts that DID follow multiple furries may have used the \\"suggested\\" follows after following ONE furry, which makes it even more interesting to me how they ended up on my account on the ones where 99% of the other users in the list appeared to be very, very much **not furries**\\n- Referencing some of the data in an earlier section of this post, theseuser accounts appeared to be primarily, but not exclusively, registered in China\\n\\n---\\n\\nAs of now, I\'m not sure exactly what conclusion to draw as to what these accounts\' purpose is/was, but I do feel fairly confident in two things.\\n\\n1) These accounts do not appear to be specifically targeting anyone or any particular groups, but rather may be following anyone in the \\"suggested\\" users list\\n\\n2) TikTok account verification (at sign-up and after bulk following activity) is not strong enough to block activity like this and needs improvement.\\n\\nMy gut tells me this behavior is an attempt to \\"age-up\\" TikTok accounts for a future spam (or, if we want to get even more sinister, misinformation/disinformation) campaign, but at this point in time that is unclear and I do not have any strong, specific evidence for that. Just a gut feeling. \\n\\nI feel like TikTok should prioritize dealing with these accounts over punishing (often, but not exclusively I\'m sure) furry creators because of false reports and (maybe) busted content-ID(?). Others have voiced these concerns better than I have, I\'m sure. \\n\\nThe bright side is so many of the early accounts listed here have, after a few days, been taken down. However, not before they could follow hundreds of users, and who knows if anyone was DM\'d or interacted with any content in that time before the accounts were terminated. I did not observe any Likes, Comments, or DMs from these accounts on my own profile, but I\'d be interested to know what others\' experiences have been. \\n\\nI will update this post as more accounts follow me and with any other insights I can provide. I know this conclusion is probably not as exciting as I might have set up for at the start of the post, but I still think it\'s interesting to try and figure out what these accounts have in common and to ponder what they might be for. \\n\\n---\\n\\nFinal note: some shameless self promo! I\'m on TikTok [@astra.bun](https://www.tiktok.com/@astra.bun/). I post comedy skits, dancing/lip sync videos, and singing/music projects all with my VRChat Avatar involved for visuals, as well as some Twitch clips from my Twitch channel. As much as I sometimes dislike the platform, I also feel myself drawn to it and can\'t leave :sweat_smile:.\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\nList of accounts\\n  - lc42435c9c: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - n66581b6f: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - x32fc497dc: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - pdbae77bef: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - k74f8a9e4f: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - lc7af668f: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - p125abbdcb: Live (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - i8c495666e: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - p1dcdb5f: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - i880eOfeOa: Banned (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - p183eb8fb: Live (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - akayxyuwjejbg: Live (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n  - lc53eb68c: Live (as of 2022-09-19) (Response to my report the day they followed: \\"No Violation\\")\\n\\n--\x3e"},{"id":"2022/09/19/welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/2022/09/19/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-19-welcome/index.mdx","title":"Welcome","description":"Hello and welcome to my blog!","date":"2022-09-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 19, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":1.27,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Astra","title":"Certified Rabbit","url":"https://astrabun.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/astrabun.png","key":"astra"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"2022/09/19/welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["astra"],"tags":[]},"prevItem":{"title":"The Curious Case of az09813: The Pattern So Far","permalink":"/2022/09/20/tiktok-strange-follows"}},"content":"Hello and welcome to my blog!\\n\\nI plan on using this space to document projects I\'m working on and other longer-form text content that doesn\'t quite belong on other platforms on which I am a user. \\n\\nFor the time being, I\'m planning on using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to maintain this blog due to its simplicity in setup and authoring.
